# Course Setup for Day 1

In this course we will demonstrate how to run some standard analysis tools for RNA-seq data. The majority of Bioinformatics tools are built with a *command-line* environment in mind, rather than Windows or Mac OSX. To simplify the installation of these tools, we are providing some resources on the *cloud* that you can log into for the duration of the course. 

## 1. Create an account at InstanceHub

*InstanceHub* is a tool created at The University of Sheffield for creating cloud resources for computing practicals. You will need to go to [instancehub.com](instancehub.com) and create an account. **Make sure that you specify the same email address that you signed-up to the course**.


## 2. Launch the Lab 

Choose the menu option *View my labs* on the left-hand menu. The lab **Introduction to RNA-seq - Day 1** should be visible. Click the *Participate* button.

## 3. Connect to the lab

Press the *Start Lab* (green) button and wait until the *Start Lab* button and wait

Once *Start Lab* has been replaced by *Disconnect*, the *Connection Information* tab will be updated with an IP address etc.

Enter the following address in your web browser 

Replacing **IP_ADDRESS** with the numbers next to **Instance IP** in the *Connection Information* box.

```
http://IP_ADDRESS:6080
```

e.g. 

```
http://3.8.149.23:6080
```

## 4. Open a termninal window

You should be presented with a unix desktop environment that we can use to learn about the command-line and tools for processing RNA-seq data.

To open a *Terminal* (in order to enter Unix commands), there is a "Start menu" in the bottom-left corner from which you can select *System Tools* and then *LXTerminal*

## 5. Change user

Finally, in order to follow the materials we need to change the user that we logged in as from `root` to `dcuser`.

Type the command into the terminal window exactly as it appears below

```
su - dcuser
```
